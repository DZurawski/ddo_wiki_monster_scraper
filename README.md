# DDO Wiki Monster Scraper

Run main.py using python.
It will ask you to supply a DDO quest name.
Once given a quest name, it will print out information about the monsters that show up in this quest.

This script was made because I found it difficult to determine the alignments of monsters within quests. I wanted a convenient way of looking up these monster alignments.
